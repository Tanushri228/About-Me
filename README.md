🌿 Hey there, glad you stopped by!
Welcome to my little corner of GitHub — where curiosity meets career goals.

I'm Tanushri (but you can call me Tanu), a data analyst with a healthy skepticism for shortcuts and a deep respect for doing things the right way. Around here, I’m always building, learning, and sharing as I go.

Here’s what you’ll find:

🔧 Real-world projects I’m working on or contributing to — built to solve problems, not just pass time.

📊 Lessons learned while navigating tight deadlines, messy data, and those classic “why won’t this work?” moments.

🌱 A few honest, hopefully helpful thoughts for anyone trying to grow in the corporate world without losing their mind — or their sense of purpose.

If you’re into practical solutions, clean data, and steady progress, you’ll feel right at home.
